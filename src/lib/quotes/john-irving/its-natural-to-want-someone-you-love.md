title: It's natural to want someone you love
dateAdded: 2019-03-07
text: It's natural to want someone you love to do what you want, or what you think would be good for them, but you have to let everything happen to them. You can't interfere with people you love any more than you're supposed to interfere with people you don't even know. And that's hard, because you often feel like interfering â€” you want to be the one who makes the plans.
